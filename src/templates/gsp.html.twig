            <span>Global Soundscapes Project</span>
        </h1>
        <p>
            The project unites soundscape science across terrestrial, marine, and freshwater, and urban systems and comprises 159 collaborators who contribute meta-data from 392 soundscape recording datasets (as of 2022-07-22).
        </p>
        <p>
            The project is open to new collaborators (contact: kdarras#at#gwdg#dot#de) and aims to serve as a useful starting point for novel soundscape-based analyses.

        </h5>
        <p>
Biodiversity and environmental phenomena are monitored acoustically worldwide by researchers, managers and practitioners above and under water and land, in natural and human-made environments. We compiled a comprehensive meta-dataset for the first global, quantitative synthesis of soundscapes. With  a unified global framework, we determined the current state of knowledge and identify research gaps and biases. The current spatial, temporal, ecological (across ecosystem types, taxa, and protected areas), and administrative sampling coverage highlights gaping sampling gaps between biomes and strong temporal sampling biases.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>Selected datasets from the Global Soundscape Projects will be uploaded and analysed on ecoSound-web for a second global synthesis on the biophony, anthropophony, and geophony. We will invite their creators as co-authors.</span>
